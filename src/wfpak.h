/* The Weather File Story ...

Weather files are efficiently packed binary files with hold up to a full year
of hourly data to drive simulation programs.

These formats are in use for BSGS applications --

   BSGS (or PC or TMP)
   		A "temporary" format put together for the original CALPAS3
		port to MS-DOS systems (in 1984?).  Each record contains only
		the 6 data items required by CALPAS-style simulation.
		A DEMO variant of this format also exists in which the data
		order in the hourly records is scrambled.  This allows free
		distribution of educational/demonstration programs which
		can read only altered (demo) weather data and cannot be used
		professionally with real data.  As of 1990, wfread is
		set up to decode both the standard and demo variants, but a
		demo-only version of wfread could be easily resurrected.

   ET1		Energy-10 version 1, October 1994. Many fields added to header.
		Data for monthly design days added. Hourly data is same as BSGS,
		plus global radiation and cloud cover.

   BSG   	The original format used on Data General systems, with 10
		data items per record.  As of 1990, this format is probably
		defunct, given the complete conversion to PCs.  Record format
		is documented only in obscure notes in Chip's possession.
		Support for this format eliminated from CSE code 10-27-91.

All formats begin with a header which identifies the file.  The header and
record layouts are described below for BSGS format; the header
format for ET1 is given as a C structure after these comments. Data records
follow the header; where used (in ET1) monthly design day data records
follow the regular daily data.

=== BSGS (aka PC or TMP) format header layout ===

A BSGS header is 576 bytes long (4 daily records of 24 * 6 bytes) and is divided
into a number of fields.  All data in the header is ASCII (for human
readability).  Header offsets are found in wfpak:wfOpen and wfpak3:wfBuildHdr
and MUST BE MAINTAINED BY HAND if layout changes, 8-17-90.

Item		Offset beg/end	Description
--------------	--------------	---------------------------------------------
File type	  0   2		Code identifying file format.  All BSGS PC
				files are "TMP"
Pack date/time	  3  12		Year, month, day, hour, minute (2 chars each)
				when file was packed (that is, written in
				packed binary format).
Packer ID	 13  17		Code identifying program which wrote file.
				Offset 13 is always "P", offsets 14 - 17 are
 				used for serial numbering of CALPAS3 files
				(ignored by TK/CR).  A 255 (0xff) at offset
				14 indicates file is DEMO format (see above).
File name	 18  48		For checking.  31 char length derived from
				DG filename length limit.
File origin	 49  52		Code indicating source of file.  All BSGS
				say "BSG"? CECrv2 files say "BSGS"--rob.
Location	 53  82		Text indicating city/state of observation,
				eg "CEC Zone 12 Rev 2".
Location ID	 83  93		ID for location, generally the WBAN number
				of the observation site.  Larger field was
				left to accomodate possible WMO codes etc.
Weather year	 94  95		If real year, value xx indicates data from
				19xx.  "-1" for fabricated years (eg TMYs)
Latitude	 96 101		Site latitude, deg N.
Longitude	102 108		Site longitude, deg W.
Time zone	109 114		Site time zone, hours W of Greenwich.  Note
				this can be non-integral.
Elevation	115 119		Elevation, ft above sea level.  0 on all
				current files?
First day	120 122		Day of year (1-365) of first data record
			        (allows short files for test data etc)
Last day	123 125		Day of year (1-365) of last data record.
(Unused)	126 143
Comment		144 287		Any documenting text


=== BSGS (aka PC or TMP) format data record layout ===

Although hourly data records are independent, they are read in daily groups
of 24 (see wfread).  Each hourly record consists of 3 16 bit words
(6 bytes per hour), organized as follows:

Item		    Word/bits   Description
--------------	----------  ----------------------------------------------
Dry bulb        1   0 -  9	High 10 bits contain DB + 100 to nearest F.
Wet bulb dep	   10 - 15	Low 6 bits contain DB - WB, so wet bulb
				            can be calculated.
Beam irrad      2   0 - 11	High 12 bits contain beam irradiance (solar
                            beam rad incident on tracking surface, Btu).
Wind dir           12 - 15	Low 4 bits contain wind direction in 16-ants,
				            WD = 22.5 * file value, 0 = north, 90 east.
Diff irrad	    3   0 -  8	High 9 bits contain diffuse irradiance (sky
                            radiation incident on horiz surface, Btu).
Wind speed          9 - 15  Low 7 bits contain wind speed, mph.

-- Additional values in ET1 file ---
Glob irrad      4   0 - 11	High 12 bits contain global irradiance incident
                            on a horizontal surface, Btu/ft2.
Cld Cover       4  12 - 15	Low 4 bits contain cloud cover in tenths, 0-10,
                            or 15 for missing data. Opaque cloud cover
                            if available on source, else total cloud cover.

Total size of a full year BSGS file is (365 + 4) * 24 * 6 = 53,136 bytes.

   struct declaration; records are unpacked by code to WFDATA struct (below). */
