/* notes for future, 2-95:

   1. Present implementation believed good without SGDISTs;
      may be slow with SGDISTs & many windows & surfaces;
      does not support out-of-zone SGDISTs with correct shade control.
      But NREL not using SGDISTs as of 2-95.

   2. For more speed for SGDISTs in large buildings, chain surface-sides by zone at setup (cncult3).
      4 chains: XSRAT CTMEXTWALL and CTMINTWALL surface insides in zone,
                XSRAT CTMEXTWALL and CTMINTWALL surface outsides in zone,
                MSRAT .insides in zone,
                MSRAT .outsides in zone.
      4 chain heads in ZNR, 2 chains in XSRAT, 1 in MASSBC (with MSRAT subscripts).
      Use in SgThruWin::doit(), and re enhanced toZoneCav() (next).

       3. Permitting SGDISTs to zones other than window's zone:
          toZoneCav() must work with control zone != target zone: to do so, it must loop over
          all surfaces in the zone and distribute to zone air per cavAbs (with split for each surface).
          Probably do new code such that can also be used for normal distribution
          and delete the global split-adjustment and cavity-distribution stuff at end of makHrSgt().

       4. Are the mass & znCAir accumulator member variables worth the complexity they add,
          especially with #3? (#3 could eliminate cavity accumulator). */

/*-------------------------- SOLAR GAIN OVERVIEW ----------------------------

Sun falls on XSURFs (opaque surfaces and windows),
and heats TARGETs (zone air, mass inside and outside surfaces):

Targetting is handled approx as follows: Sun on windows: heats (insides of)
masses per user input and (1995) automatic distribution; rest heats zone air
("CAIR", .znCAir); Sun on os: heavy: heats outside of the mass; light: some
heats zone air.

NEWSGT: In 1995 the window solar gain targetting was changed to a cavity
absorptance model in which gain is distributed to surfaces in proportion to
their area and absorptivity, allowing for portions of reflected sun that
go back out windows and that are later absorbed after reflection. All surfaces
are assumed to have uniform views of each other, as though the zone were a
single room and the room interior were spherical. Since the distribution
depends on the surface absorptivities and the glazing Solar Heat Gain
Coefficients, both monthly-hourly variable, the apportionment amoung surfaces
is computed here. Insolation automatically apportioned to massive surfaces
is directed thereto (a change, 1995); only insolation automatically apportioned
to light surfaces now goes to the zone "air".

The solar gain of each target depends on the following factors (at least):
    Fixed for of run:
        latitude of location;
        area, orientation, and shading of each surface or opening
           (more than one may heat the same target).
    Approximated monthly:
        declination of earth's axis (sun's position in sky for date)
    Change hourly but predictably (same for at least a month):
        sun's position in sky;
        absorptance of each surface (monthly-hourly schedulable).
        distribution of sun on masses per user SGDIST input
    Change hourly:
        whether operable window shades are closed (which changes window
           SHGC and SGDIST solar gain distibution);
	hourly weather from file: beam and diffuse radiation for hour.

The diffuse solar gain factor, and each hour's beam solar gain factor,
to each target and for each control variable (zone window shade positions),
are tabulated in SGRAT SgR by code here.  The hourly simulation cycle
(cnloads.cpp called by cnguts.cpp, 1995) then multiplies these values by
weather data radiation values and adds the products to the respective targets.

Shades recap: when a window has movable shades, XSURF.scc (from wn/gtSMSC)
differs from XSURF.sco (from wn/gtSMSO). Code here then tabulates the factors
for shades open, and the shades closed difference. The cnloads.cpp then uses
a combination of the factors according to the hour's shade position, via
the "control" pointer in the SGRAT struct (next topic). */

/*------------------------ SOLAR GAIN TABLES STORY -----------------------

The SGRAT record structure (app\cnrecs.def) plus the weather data allow
computing the gain to one target under control of one control variable,
and is valid for one month.  Approx:

  struct SGRAT
  {  ...
     SI addIt;		* flag nz to add gain, 0 to store (target's 1st entry)
     SGTARG *target;	* (float *) where to store/add gain
     float *control;	* NULL or 0..1 to multiply gain, eg zn shades position
     float beam[24];	* multiply by hourly beam radiation for gain
     float diff[24];	* multiply by hourly diffuse radiation ditto
  };

"control"s in the above: normally NULL, gain not controlled.
A second SGRAT record is used when:

   a window's gain can be reduced by closing its shades (XSURF.scc < .sco), or

   solar gain distribution changes when shades closed (SGDIST.sd_FSC < .sd_FSO)

The second SGRAT record's beam and diff contain the DIFFERENCE in gain,
usually negative, when the shades are closed. and its .control points
to its zone's ZNR.i.znSC (shade closure, former shutter fraction).
Each zone's .znSC may be input by user (subhourly expr), or defaults to 1.0
when heating, 0.0 when cooling (set in cnloads:loadsAfterSubhr).

Solar gain data is valid for a month: 24 hourly beam and diff values are
stored; inputs vary little (sun position) or not allowed to vary (SHGC's,
sfExAbs, etc) during month. Solar gain data is computed on the
first day of each month, then used for the entire month (or until an input
changes -- believe no such at present 2-95).  cnguts.cpp calls makHrSgt at
each hour of the simulation cycle on days when solar data must be computed. */

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof that makHrSgt can compute "split" as uval/uX, 2-95

  given: uI = outside film conductance, uC = wall construction cond, uI = inside film cond.

  to compute "split", the fraction of sun falling on outside of wall that gets to inside air.

----- makHrSgt (next) in CSE notes -----

calling context:
    CSE input includes 1 or more ZONES (ZNRs) each w a chain of exterior
       wall & window components (XSURFs in XSRAT).
    Solar gain targetting is specified in XSURF's array sgdist[]
       of fractional solar distributions to zones and masses.

makHrSgt() is called for each hour of the day, during the simulation cycle,
    on days when the solar tables need to be calculated: whenever an input
    has changed: new month (no others 2-95?).

one makHrSgt() call does:
    Integrates XSURF size/orientation/shading/absorptivity/schedulable SHGC
    etc information and SGDIST explicit solar distribution information with
    sun's position for date and hour, plus ground reflectivity, etc,
    to produce solar gain info for ALL TARGETS for shades OPEN and the
    difference for shades CLOSED for one hour of one month.
    Multiple gains to the same target are summed into one table.
    Each gain table includes beam values for 24 hours and is used (combined
    with hourly weather data every hour) for a month or until another input
    changes;  24 calls are thus needed to fill the table.

A Solar Gain Table entry (SGRAT record) contains:
	a pointer to a TARGET (float * place to add gain to)
	a pointer to a control variable to multiply gain, or NULL
	1 single diffuse and 24 hourly beam RADIATION MULTIPLIERS.

The possible targets (2-95) for gain are:
		ZNR.qSgAir	zone air
		ZNR.qSgTot	zone total (redundant check/report value)
		ZNR.qSgTotSh	ditto, subhourly portion
		MASSBC[].sg	mass inside [0], mass outside [1].

Control variables: each target has an SGRAT record with NULL .control.
In addition, if there is a controlled portion of its gain, it contains
ANOTHER SGRAT entry with the appropropriate control pointer and radiation
multipliers for the DIFFERENCE in gain when the control variable is 1.0.

At present (1992-95), controls are only used for operable window shades:
if a window's xsurf's .scc < .sco or if SGDIST.sd_FSC != .sd_FSO,
an additional SGRAT entry is made, containing the change in gain (usually
NEGATIVE radiation multipliers) and a pointer to its zone's ZNR.i.znSC.
User-inputtable ZNR.i.znSC (shade closure, formerly shutter fraction) defaults
to 1. when heating and 0. when cooling (cnloads.cpp:loadsAfterSubhr). */
