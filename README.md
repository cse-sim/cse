### Development

CSE is configured as a CMake project. Currently, CMake is only configured to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solutions compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ (other generators and compilers will not work). A batch script is set up for automatic project setup. Simply double click or run the **build.bat** script in the root directory. All products (e.g., CSE.exe) will be placed in a directory called **msvc**.

#### Testing

Automated testing of your build can be executed by running

`ctest -C Release`

from the **msvc\\build** directory.

#### Dependencies

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 with Visual C++ and Support for Windows XP (v141_xp toolset)
- CMake 3.10 or later

Note: Generating the documentation requires additional tools. See [doc\\README.md](doc/README.md).
