# SURFACE

Surface constructs a ZONE subobject of class SURFACE that represents a surrounding or interior surface of the zone. Internally, SURFACE generates a QUICK surface (U-value only), a DELAYED (massive) surface (using the finite-difference mass model), interzone QUICK surface, or interzone DELAYED surface, as appropriate for the specified construction and exterior conditions.

**sfName**

Name of surface; give after the word SURFACE.

<%= member_table(

  legal_range: "*63 characters*",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**sfType=*choice***

Type of surface:

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
FLOOR, Surface defines part or all of the 'bottom' of the zone; it is horizontal with inside facing up. The outside of the surface is not adjacent to the current zone.
WALL, Surface defines a 'side' of the zone; its outside is not adjacent to the current zone.
CEILING, Surface defines part or all of the 'top' of the zone with the inside facing down. The outside of the surface is not adjacent to the current zone.
END
%>

sfType is used extensively for default determination and input checking, but does not have any further internal effect. The Floor, Wall, and Ceiling choices identify surfaces that form boundaries between the zone and some other condition.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "FLOOR WALL CEILING",

**sfTilt=*float***

Surface tilt from horizontal. Values outside the range 0 to 360 are first normalized to that range. The default and allowed range depend on sfType, as follows:

  ------------------ -------------------------------------------
  sfType = FLOOR     *sfTilt*=180, default = 180 (fixed value)
  sfType = WALL      60 $<$ *sfTilt* $<$ 180, default = 90

  default: "Dependent upon *sfType* See above",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**sfAzm=*float***

Azimuth of surface with respect to znAzm. The azimuth used in simulating a surface is bldgAzm + znAzm + sfAzm; the surface is rotated if any of those are changed. Values outside the range 0 to 360 are normalized to that range. Required for non-horizontal surfaces.

**sfModel=*choice***

Provides user control over how CSE models conduction for this surface.

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
QUICK,                               Surface is modeled using a simple conductance. Heat capacity effects are ignored. Either sfCon or sfU (next) can be specified.
DELAYED&comma; DELAYED\_HOUR&comma; DELAYED\_SUBHOUR, Surface is modeled using a multi-layer finite difference technique that represents heat capacity effects. If the time constant of the surface is too short to accurately simulate&comma; a warning message is issued and the Quick model is used. The program **cannot** use the finite difference model if sfU rather than sfCon is specified.
AUTO, Program selects Quick or the appropriate Delayed automatically according to the time constant of the surface (if sfU is specified&comma; Quick is selected).
FD (or FORWARD\_DIFFERENCE),         Selects the forward difference model (used with short time steps and the CZM/UZM zone model).
KIVA,                                Uses a two-dimensional finite difference model to simulate heat flow through foundation surfaces.

<!--
TODO: better sfModel desciptions

Either sfU or sfCon must be specified, but not both.

**sfU=*float***

Surface U-value (NOT including surface (air film) conductances). For surfaces for which no heat capacity is to be modeled, allows direct entry of U-value without defining a CONSTRUCTION.

  default: "*none*",

  variability: "constant") %>

**sfLThkF=*float***

Sublayer thickness adjustment factor for FORWARD\_DIFFERENCE conduction model used with sfCon surfaces.  Material layers in the construction are divided into sublayers as needed for numerical stability.  sfLThkF allows adjustment of the thickness criterion used for subdivision.  A value of 0 prevents subdivision; the default value (0.5) uses layers with conservative thickness equal to half of an estimated safe value.  Fewer (thicker) sublayers improves runtime at the expense of accurate representation of rapid changes.

  legal_range: "*x* $\\ge$ 0",
  default: "0.5",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**sfExCnd=*choice***

Specifies the thermal conditions assumed at surface exterior, and at exterior of any subobjects (windows or doors) belonging to current surface. The conditions accounted for are dry bulb temperature and incident solar radiation.

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
AMBIENT,        Exterior surface is exposed to the 'weather' as read from the weather file. Solar gain is calculated using solar geometry&comma; sfAzm&comma; sfTilt&comma; and sfExAbs.
SPECIFIEDT,     Exterior surface is exposed to solar radiation as in AMBIENT&comma; but the dry bulb temperature is calculated with a user specified function (sfExT). sfExAbs can be set to 0 to eliminate solar effects.
ADJZN,          Exterior surface is exposed to another zone&comma; whose name is specified by sfAdjZn. Solar gain is 0 unless gain is targeted to the surface with SGDIST below.
GROUND,         The surface is in contact with the ground. Details of the two-dimensional foundation design are defined by sfFnd. Only floor and wall surfaces may use this option.
ADIABATIC, Exterior surface heat flow is 0. Thermal storage effects of delayed surfaces are modeled.
