# ZONE

ZONE constructs an object of class ZONE, which describes an area of the building to be modeled as having a uniform condition. ZONEs are large, complex objects and can have many subobjects that describe associated surfaces, shading devices, HVAC equipment, etc.

## ZONE General Members

## ZONE Infiltration

The following control a simplified air change plus leakage area model. The Sherman-Grimsrud model is used to derive air flow rate from leakage area and this rate is added to the air changes specified with infAC. Note that TOP.windF does *not* modify calculated infiltration rates, since the Sherman-Grimsrud model uses its own modifiers. See also AirNet models available via IZXFER.

**infAC=*float***

  variability: "constant")
  %>

**znWindFLkg=*float***

  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**znAFMtr=*afMtrName***

Name of an AFMETER object, if any, to which zone AirNet air flows are recorded.  *ZnAFMtr* defines a pressure boundary for accounting purposes.  Multiple zones having the same AFMETER are treated as a single volume -- interzone flows within that volume are not recorded.  For example, to obtain "building total" flow data, a common AFMETER could be assigned to several conditioned zones but not to adjacent unconditioned zones such as attic spaces.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",

  default: "*not recorded*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")

  variability: "constant")
  %>

## ZONE Exhaust Fan

Presence of an exhaust fan in a zone is indicated by specifying a non-zero design flow value (xfanVfDs).

Zone exhaust fan model implementation is incomplete as of July, 2011. The current code calculates energy use but does not account for the effects of air transfer on room heat balance. IZXFER provides a more complete implementation.

**xfanFOn=*float***

Exhaust fan on fraction. On/off control assumed, so electricity requirement is proportional to run time.

<%= member_table(
  units: "fraction",
  legal_range: "0 $\\leq$ x $\\leq$ 1",
  default: "1",
  required: "No",
  variability: "hourly")
  %>

Example: The following would run an exhaust fan 70% of the time between 8 AM and 5 PM:

        xfanFOn = select( (\$hour >= 7 && \$hour < 5), .7,
                                              default, 0 );


**xfanVfDs=*float***

Exhaust fan design flow; 0 or not given indicates no fan.

<%= member_table(
  units: "cfm",
  legal_range: "x $\\geq$ 0",
  default: "0, no fan",
  required: "If fan present",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**xfanPress=*float***

Exhaust fan external static pressure.

<%= member_table(
  units: "inches",
  legal_range: "0.05 $\\leq$ *x* $\\leq$ 1.0",
  default: "0.3",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

Only one of xfanElecPwr, xfanEff, and xfanShaftBhp may be given: together with xfanVfDs and xfanPress, any one is sufficient for CSE to detemine the others and to compute the fan heat contribution to the air stream.

**xfanElecPwr=*float***

Fan input power per unit air flow (at design flow and pressure).

<%= member_table(
  units: "W/cfm",
  legal_range: "x $>$ 0",
  default: "derived from xfanEff",
  required: "If xfanEff and xfanShaftBhp not present",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**xfanEff=*float***

Exhaust fan/motor/drive combined efficiency.

<%= member_table(
  units: "fraction",
  legal_range: "0 $\\leq$ x $\\leq$ 1",
  default: "0.08",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**xfanShaftBhp=*float***

Fan shaft power at design flow and pressure.

<%= member_table(
  units: "BHP",
  legal_range: "x $>$ 0",
  default: "derived from xfanElecPwr and xfanVfDs",
  required: "If xfanElecPwr not present",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**xfanMtr=*mtrName***

Name of METER object, if any, by which fan's energy use is recorded (under end use category "fan").

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*name of a METER*",
  default: "*not recorded*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**endZone**

Indicates the end of the zone definition. Alternatively, the end of the zone definition can be indicated by the declaration of another object or by "END". If END or endZone is used, it should follow the definitions of the ZONE's subobjects such as GAINs, SURFACEs, TERMINALs, etc.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
