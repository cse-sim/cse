# DOOR

DOOR constructs a subobject belonging to the current SURFACE. The azimuth, tilt, ground reflectivity and exterior conditions associated with the door are the same as those of the owning surface, although the exterior surface conductance and the exterior absorptivity can be altered.

**drName**

Name of door.

**drModel=*choice***

Provides user control over how CSE models conduction for this door:

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
  QUICK,                               Surface is modeled using a simple conductance. Heat capacity effects are ignored. Either drCon or drU (next) can be specified.
  DELAYED&comma; DELAYED\_HOUR&comma; DELAYED\_SUBOUR,  Surface is modeled using a multi-layer finite difference technique which represents heat capacity effects. If the time constant of the door is too short to accurately simulate&comma; a warning message is issued and the Quick model is used. drCon (next) must be specified -- the program cannot use the finite difference model if drU rather than drCon is specified.
  AUTO,                                Program selects Quick or appropriate Delayed automatically according to the time constant of the surface (if drU is specified&comma; Quick is selected).
  FD or FORWARD\_DIFFERENCE,           Selects the forward difference model (used with short time steps and the CZM/UZM zone models)

Either drU or drCon must be specified, but not both.

**drU=*float***

Door U-value, NOT including surface (air film) conductances. Allows direct entry of U-value, without defining a CONSTRUCTION, when no heat capacity effects are to be modeled.

<%= member_table(
  units: "Btuh/ft^2^-^o^F",
  legal_range: "x $>$ 0",
  default: "Determined from *drCon*",

**drCon=*conName***

Name of construction for door.

  units: "",
  legal_range: "name of a *CONSTRUCTION*",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "unless *drU* given",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**drLThkF=*float***

Sublayer thickness adjustment factor for FORWARD\_DIFFERENCE conduction model used with drCon surfaces.  Material layers in the construction are divided into sublayers as needed for numerical stability.  drLThkF allows adjustment of the thickness criterion used for subdivision.  A value of 0 prevents subdivision; the default value (0.5) uses layers with conservative thickness equal to half of an estimated safe value.  Fewer (thicker) sublayers improves runtime at the expense of accurate representation of rapid changes.

<%= member_table(

  required: "No",

  When drModel = Forward\_Difference, several models are available for calculating inside and outside surface convective coefficients.  Inside surface faces can be exposed only to zone conditions. Outside faces may be exposed either to ambient conditions or zone conditions, based on drExCnd.  Only UNIFIED and INPUT are typically used.  The other models were used during CSE development for comparison.  For details, see CSE Engineering Documentation.
