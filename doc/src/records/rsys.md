**rsDSEC=*float***

Cooling distribution system efficiency.  If given, (1-rsDSEC) of RSYS cooling output is discarded.  Cannot be combined with more detailed DUCTSEG model.

  **rsOAVType=*choice***

  Type of central fan integrated (CFI) outside air ventilation (OAV) included in this RSYS.  OAV systems use the central system fan to circulate outdoor air (e.g. for night ventilation).

  OAV cannot operate simultaneously with whole building ventilation (operable windows, whole house fans, etc.).  Availability of ventilation modes is controlled on an hourly basis via  [Top ventAvail](#top-model-control-items).

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
NONE,       No CFI ventilation capabilities
FIXED,      Fixed-flow CFI (aka SmartVent). The specified rsOAVVfDs is used whenever the RSYS operates in OAV mode.
VARIABLE,   Variable-flow CFI (aka NightBreeze). Flow rate is determined at midnight based on prior day's average dry-bulb temperature according to a control algorithm defined by the NightBreeze vendor.

 Minimum air volume flow rate fraction when RSYS is operating in OAV mode.  When rsOAVType=VARIABLE, air flow rate is constrained to rsOAVVfMinF * rsOAVVfDs or greater.

**rsOAVTDbInlet=*float***

OAV inlet (source) air temperature.  Supply air temperature at the zone is generally higher due to fan heat.  Duct losses, if any, also alter the supply air temperature.

**rsOAVTdiff=*float***

 OAV temperature differential.  When operating in OAV mode, the zone set point temperature is max( znTD, inletT+rsOAVTdiff).  Small values can result in inadvertent zone heating, due to fan heat.

Name of zone to which relief air is directed during RSYS OAV operation, typically an attic zone.  Relief air flow is included in the target zone's pressure and thermal balance.
