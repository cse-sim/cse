# IZXFER

IZXFER constructs an object that represents an interzone or zone/ambient heat transfer due to conduction and/or air transfer. The air transfer modeled by IZXFER transfers heat only; humidity transfer is not modeled as of July 2011. Note that SURFACE is the preferred way represent conduction between ZONEs.

The AIRNET types are used in a multi-cell pressure balancing model that finds zone pressures that produce net 0 mass flow into each zone. The model operates in concert with the znType=CZM or znType=UZM to represent ventilation strategies. During each time step, the pressure balance is found for two modes that can be thought of as “VentOff” (or infiltration-only) and “VentOn” (or infiltration+ventilation). The zone model then determines the ventilation fraction required to hold the desired zone temperature (if possible). AIRNET modeling methods are documented in the CSE Engineering Documentation.

Note that fan-driven types assume pressure-independent flow.  That is, the specified flow is included in the zone pressure balance but the modeled fan flow does not change with zone pressure.
The assumption is that in realistic configurations, zone pressure will generally be close to ambient pressure.  Unbalanced fan ventilation in a zone without relief area will result in runtime termination due to excessively high or low pressure.

**izName**

Optional name of interzone transfer; give after the word "IZXFER" if desired.

**izNVType=*choice***

Choice determining interzone ventilation

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
  NONE,             No interzone ventilation
  ONEWAY,           Uncontrolled flow from izZn1 to izZn2 when izZn1 air temperature exceeds izZn2 air temperature (using ASHRAE high/low vent model).
  TWOWAY,           Uncontrolled flow in either direction (using ASHRAE high/low vent model).
  AIRNETIZ,         Single opening to another zone (using pressure balance AirNet model).  Flow is driven by buoyancy.
  AIRNETEXT,        Single opening to ambient (using pressure balance AirNet model).  Flow is driven by buoyancy and wind pressure.
  AIRNETHORIZ,      Horizontal (large) opening between two zones&comma; used to represent e.g. stairwells.  Flow is driven by buoyancy; simultaneous up and down flow is modeled.
  AIRNETEXTFAN,     Fan from exterior to zone (flow either direction).
  AIRNETIZFAN,      Fan between two zones (flow either direction).
  AIRNETEXTFLOW,    Specified flow from exterior to zone (either direction). Behaves identically to AIRNETEXTFAN except no electricity is consumed and no fan heat is added to the air stream.
  AIRNETIZFLOW,     Specified flow between two zones (either direction). Behaves identically to AIRNETIZFAN except no electricity is consumed and no fan heat is added to the air stream.
  AIRNETHERV,       Heat or energy recovery ventilator. Supply and exhaust air are exchanged with the exterior with heat and/or moisture exchange between the air streams. Flow may or may not be balanced.
  AIRNETDOAS,      Air supplied from and/or exhausted to a centralized DOAS fans.

**izAFCat=*choice***

Choice indicating air flow category used *only* for recording air flow results to an AFMETER.  izAFCat has no effect for non-AIRNET IZXFERs.  izAFCat is not used unless the associated ZONE(s) specify znAFMtr.


Choices are:

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
  InfilEx,      Infiltration from ambient
  VentEx,       Natural ventilation from ambient
	FanEx,        Forced ventilation from ambient
	InfilIz,      Interzone infiltration
	VentIz,       Interzone natural ventilation
	FanIz,        Interzone forced ventilation
	DuctLk,       Duct leakage
	HVAC,         HVAC air
END
%>

Default values for izAFCat are generally adequate *except* that natural ventilation IZXFERs are by default categorized as infiltration.  It is thus recommended that izAfCat be omitted except that ventilation IZXFERs (e.g. representing openable windows) should include izAfCat=VentEx (or VentIz).

**izASEF=*float***

Apparent sensible effectiveness for AIRNETHERV ventilator.  ASEF is a commonly-reported HERV rating and is calculated as (supplyT - sourceT) / (returnT - sourceT).  This formulation includes fan heat (in supplyT), hence the term "apparent".  Ignored if izSRE is given.  CSE does not HRV exhaust-side condensation, so this model is approximate.

Note that values of SRE greater than approximately 0.6 imply exhaust-side condensation under HVI rating conditions.  CSE does not adjust for these effects.  High values of izSRE will produce unrealistic results under mild outdoor conditions and/or dry indoor conditions.

**izfanCurvePy=$k_0$, $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, $x_0$**

$k_0$ through $k_3$ are the coefficients of a cubic polynomial for the curve relating fan relative energy consumption to relative air flow above the minimum flow $x_0$. Up to five *floats* may be given, separated by commas. 0 is used for any omitted trailing values. The values are used as follows:

$$z = k_0 + k_1 \cdot (x - x_0)|  +  k_2 \cdot (x - x_0)|^2 + k_3 \cdot (x - x_0)|^3$$

where:

-   $x$ is the relative fan air flow (as fraction of izfan*VfDs*; 0 $\le$ $x$ $\le$ 1);
-   $x_0$ is the minimum relative air flow (default 0);
-   $(x - x_0)|$ is the "positive difference", i.e. $(x - x_0)$ if $x > x_0$; else 0;
-   $z$ is the relative energy consumption.

If $z$ is not 1.0 for $x$ = 1.0, a warning message is displayed and the coefficients are normalized by dividing by the polynomial's value for $x$ = 1.0.
