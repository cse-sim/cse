# HOLIDAY

HOLIDAY objects define holidays. Holidays have no inherent effect, but input expressions can test for holidays via the \$DOWH, \$isHoliday, \$isHoliTrue, \$isWeHol, and \$isBegWeek system variables (4.6.4).

Examples and the list of default holidays are given after the member descriptions.

<!--
hdName is required in the program. WHY? 7-92.
-->
**hdName**

Name of holiday: <!-- if given,--> must follow the word HOLIDAY. <!-- Necessary only if the HOLIDAY object is referenced later with another statement, for example in a LIKE clause or with ALTER; however, we suggest always naming all objects for clearer error messages and future flexibility. -->

Examples of valid HOLIDAY object specifications:

-   Holiday on May first, observed date moved to following Monday if the first falls on a weekend (hdOnMonday defaults Yes).

            hdDateTrue = May 1;

-   Holiday on May 1, observed on May 3.

<!-- -->
        HOLIDAY MAYDAY;
            hdDateTrue = May 1;
            hdDateObs  = May 3;

-   Holiday observed on May 1 even if on a weekend.

<!-- -->
        HOLIDAY MAYDAY;
            hdDateTrue = May 1;
            hdOnMonday = No;

-   Holiday observed on Wednesday of third week of March

            hdCase = third;

If a particular default holiday is not desired, it can be removed with a DELETE statement:

        DELETE HOLIDAY Thanksgiving

        DELETE HOLIDAY "Columbus Day"  // Quotes necessary (due to space)

        DELETE HOLIDAY "VETERANS DAY"  // No case-sensitivity
