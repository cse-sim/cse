# SGDIST

SGDIST creates a subobject of the current window that distributes a specified fraction of that window's solar gain to a specified delayed model (massive) surface. Any remaining solar gain (all of the window's solar gain if no SGDISTs are given) is added to the air of the zone containing the window. A window may have up to three SGDISTs; an error occurs if more than 100% of the window's gain is distributed.

Via members sgFSO and sgFSC, the fraction of the insolation distributed to the surface can be made dependent on whether the zone's shades are open or closed (see ZONE member znSC).

**sgName**

Name of solar gain distribution (follows "SGDIST" if given).

**sgSurf=*sfName***

Name of surface to which gain is targeted.

If there is more than surface with the specified name: if one of the surfaces is in the current zone, it is used; otherwise, an error message is issued.

The specified surface must be modeled with the Delayed model. If gain is targeted to a Quick model surface, a warning message is issued and the gain is redirected to the air of the associated zone.

**sgFSO=*float***

Fraction of solar gain directed to specified surface when the owning window's interior shading is in the open position (when the window's zone's shade closure (znSC) is 0).

**sgFSC=*float***

Fraction of solar gain directed to specified surface when the owning window's interior shading is in the closed position. If the zone's shades are partly closed (znSC between 0 and 1), a proportional fraction between sgFSO and sgFSC is used.

**endSGDist**

Optionally indicates the end of the solar gain distribution definition. Alternatively, the end of the solar gain distribution definition can be indicated by END or by just beginning another object.
