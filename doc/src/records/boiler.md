# BOILER

BOILERs are subObjects of HEATPLANTs (preceding Section 5.20). BOILERs supply heat, through their associated HEATPLANT, to HW coils and heat exchangers.

Each boiler has a pump. The pump operates whenever the boiler is in use; the pump generates heat in the water, which is added to the boiler's output. The pump heat is independent of load -- the model assumes a bypass valve keeps the water flow constant when the loads are using less than full flow -- except that the heat is assumed never to exceed the load.

**boilerName**

Name of BOILER object, given immediately after the word BOILER. The name is used to refer to the boiler in heat plant stage commands.

**blrPyEi=*a, b, c, d***

Coefficients of cubic polynomial function of part load ratio (load/capacity) to adjust full-load energy input for part load operation. Up to four floats may be given, separated by commas, lowest order (i.e. constant term) coefficient first. If the given coefficients result in a polynomial whose value is not 1.0 when the input variable, part load ratio, is 1.0, a warning message will be printed and the coefficients will be normalized to produce value 1.0 at input 1.0.
