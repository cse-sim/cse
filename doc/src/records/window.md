# WINDOW

WINDOW defines a subobject belonging to the current SURFACE that represents one or more identical windows. The azimuth, tilt, and exterior conditions of the window are the same as those of the surface to which it belongs. The total window area (*wnHt* $\cdot$ *wnWid* $\cdot$ *wnMult*) is deducted from the gross surface area. A surface may have any number of windows.

Windows may optionally have operable interior shading that reduces the overall shading coefficient when closed.

**wnName**

Name of window: follows the word "WINDOW" if given.

**wnGt=*choice***

GLAZETYPE for window. Provides many defaults for window properties as cited below.

**wnU=*float***

Window conductance (U-factor without surface films, therefore not actually a U-factor but a C-factor).

Preferred Approach: To use accurately with standard winter rated U-factor from ASHRAE or NFRC enter as:

        wnU = (1/((1/U-factor)-0.85)

Where 0.85 is the sum of the interior (0.68) and exterior (0.17) design air film resistances assumed for rating window U-factors. Enter wnInH (usually 1.5=1/0.68) instead of letting it default. Enter the wnExH or let it default. It is important to use this approach if the input includes gnFrad for any gain term. Using approach 2 below will result in an inappropriate internal gain split at the window.

Approach 2. Enter wnU=U-factor and let the wnInH and wnExH default. Tnormally this approach systematically underestimates the window U-factor because it adds the wnExfilm resistance to 1/U-factor thereby double counting the exterior film resistance. This approach will also yield incorrect results for gnFrad internal gain since the high wnInH will put almost all the gain back in the space.

  %>

**wnInH=*float***

Window interior surface (air film) conductance.

Preferred Approach: Enter the appropriate value for each window, normally:

        wnInH = 1.5

        where 1.5 = 1/0.68 the standard ASHRAE value.

The large default value of 10,000 represents a near-0 resistance, for the convenience of those who wish to include the interior surface film in wnU according to approach 2 above.

Several models are available for calculating inside and outside surface convective coefficients.  Inside surface faces can be exposed only to zone conditions. Outside faces may be exposed either to ambient conditions or zone conditions, based on wnExCnd.  Only UNIFIED and INPUT are typically used.  The other models were used during CSE development for comparison.  For details, see CSE Engineering Documentation.
