# DHWSYS

DHWSYS constructs an object representing a domestic hot water system consisting of one or more hot water heaters, storage tanks, loops, and pumps (DHWHEATER, DHWTANK, DHWLOOP, and DHWPUMP, see below) and a distribution system characterized by loss parameters. This model is based on Appendix B of the 2019 Residential ACM Reference Manual and the Ecotope HPWHSim air source heat pump water heater model (called HPWH herein).

The parent-child structure of DHWSYS components is determined by input order. For example, DHWHEATERs belong to the DHWSYS that precedes them in the input file. The following hierarchy shows the relationship among components. Note that any of the commands can be repeated any number of times.

- DHWSYS
    - DHWHEATER
    - DHWLOOPHEATER
    - DHWHEATREC
    - DHWTANK
    - DHWPUMP
    - DHWLOOP
        - DHWLOOPPUMP
        - DHWLOOPSEG
            - DHWLOOPBRANCH

Minimal modeling is included for physically realistic controls. For example, if several DHWHEATERs are included in a DHWSYS, an equal fraction of the required hot water is assumed to be produced by each heater, even if they are different types or sizes. Thus a DHWSYS is in some ways a collection of components as opposed to an explicitly connected system.  This approach avoids requiring detailed input that would impose impractical user burden, especially in compliance applications.

**dhwsysName**

Optional name of system; give after the word “DHWSYS” if desired.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*63 characters*",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**wsCalcMode=*choice***

Enables preliminary simulation that derives values needed for simulation.

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => false)
  PRERUN,      Calculate hot water heating load; at end of run&comma; derive whLDEF for all child DHWHEATERs for which that value is required and defaulted (this emulates methods used in the T24DHW.DLL implementation of CEC DHW procedures). Also derived are average number of draws per day by end use (used in the wsDayWaste scheme).
  SIMULATE,    Perform full modeling calculations
END
%>

To use PRERUN efficiently, the recommended input file structure is:

- General input
- DHWSYS(s) and child objects
- RUN
- ALTER DHWSYS input (as needed)
- Building input
- RUN

This order avoids duplicate time-consuming simulation of the full building model.

  %>

**wsCentralDHWSYS=*dhwsysName***

  Name of the central DHWSYS that serves this DHWSYS, allowing representation of multiple units having distinct distribution configurations and/or water use patterns but served by a central DHWSYS.  The child DHWSYS(s) may not include DHWHEATERs -- they are "loads only" systems.  wsCentralDHWSYS and wsLoadShareDHWSYS cannot both be given.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*name of a DHWSYS*",
  default: "DHWSYS is standalone",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**wsLoadShareDHWSYS=*dhwsysName***

 Name of a DHWSYS that serves the same loads as this DHWSYS, allowing representation of multiple water heating systems within a unit. If given, wsUse and wsDayUse are not allowed, hot water requirements are derived from the referenced DHWSYS.  wsCentralDHWSYS and wsLoadShareDHWSYS cannot both be given.

 For example, two DHWSYSs should be defined to model two water heating systems serving a load represented by wsDayUse DayUseTyp.  Each DHWSYS should include DHWHEATER(s) and other components as needed.  DHWSYS Sys1 should specify wsDayUse=DayUseTyp and DHWSYS Sys2 should have wsLoadShareDHWSYS=Sys1 in place of wsDayUse.

 Loads are shared by assigning DHWUSE events sequentially by end use to all DHWSYS with compatible fixtures (determined by wsFaucetCount, wsShowerCount etc., see below) in the group.  This algorithm approximately divides load for each end use by the number of compatible fixtures in the group.  In addition, assigning 0 to a fixture type prevents assignment of an end use load to a DHWSYS -- for example, wsDWashrCount=0 could be provided for a DHWSYS that does not serve a kitchen.


<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*name of a DHWSYS*",
  default: "No shared loads",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant")
  %>

**wsMult=*float***

Number of identical systems of this type (including all child objects). Any value $> 1$ is equivalent to repeated entry of the same DHWSYS.  A value of 0 is equivalent to omitting the DHWSYS.  Non-integral values scale all results; this may be useful in parameterized models, for example.

  %>

**wsFaucetCount=*integer***\
**wsShowerCount=*integer***\
**wsBathCount=*integer***\
**wsCWashrCount=*integer***\
**wsDWashrCount=*integer***

Specifies the count of fixtures served by this DHWSYS that can accommodate draws of each end use (see DHWUSE).  These counts are used for distributing draws in shared load configurations (multiple DHWSYSs serving the same loads, see wsLoadShareDHWSYS above).

In addition, wsShowerCount participates in assignment of Shower draws to DHWHEATRECs (if any).

Unless this DHWSYS is part of a shared-load group or includes DHWHEATREC(s), these counts have no effect and need not be specified.

**wsUse=*float***

<%= member_table(
  units: "gal",
  legal_range: "x $\\ge$ 0",
  default: "0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "hourly")
  %>

**wsDayUse=*dhwdayuseName***

  Name of DHWDAYUSE object that specifies a detailed schedule of mixed water use at points of hot water use (that is, "at the tap").  The mixed water amounts are used to derive hot water requirements based on specified mixing fractions or mixed water temperature (see DHWDAYUSE and DHWUSE).

  The total water use modeled by CSE is the sum of amounts given by wsUse and the DWHDAYUSE schedule.  DHWDAYUSE draws are resolved to minute-by-minute bins compatible with the HPWH model and wsUse/60 is added to each minute bin.  Conversely, the hour total of the DHWDAYUSE amounts is included in the draw applied to non-HPWH DHWHEATERs.

  wsDayUse variability is daily, so it is possible to select different schedules as a function of day type (or any other condition), as follows --

         DHWSYS "DHW1"
           ...
           wsDayUse = choose( $isWeHol, "DUSEWeekday", "DUSEWeHol")
           ...

  Note that while DHWDAYUSE selection is updated daily, the DHWUSE values within the DHWDAYUSE can be altered hourly, providing additional scheduling flexibility.
