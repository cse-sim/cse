# TOP Members

The top-level data items (TOP members) control the simulation process or contain data that applies to the modeled building as a whole. No statement is used to begin or create the TOP object; these statements can be given anywhere in the input (they do, however, terminate any other objects being specified -- ZONEs, REPORTs, etc.).

## TOP General Data Items

**doMainSim=*choice***

Specifies whether the simulation is performed when a Run command is encountered. See also doAutoSize.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "NO, YES",
  default: "*YES*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**begDay=*date***

Date specifying the beginning day of the simulation performed when a Run command is encountered. See further discussion under endDay (next).

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*date*",
  default: "*Jan 1*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**endDay=*date***

Date specifying the ending day of the simulation performed when a Run command is encountered.

The program simulates 365 days at most. If begDay and endDay are the same, 1 day is simulated. If begDay precedes endDay in calendar sequence, the simulation is performed normally and covers begDay through endDay inclusive. If begDay follows endDay in calendar sequence, the simulation is performed across the year end, with Jan 1 immediately following Dec 31.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*date*",
  default: "*Dec 31*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**jan1DoW=*choice***

Day of week on which January 1 falls.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "SUN,\\ MON,\\ TUE,\\ WED,\\ THU,\\ FRI,\\ SAT",
  default: "THU",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**workDayMask=*int* TODO**

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "",
  required: "",
  variability: "constant") %>

**wuDays=*int***

Number of "warm-up" days used to initialize the simulator. Simulator initialization is required because thermal mass temperatures are set to arbitrary values at the beginning of the simulation. Actual mass temperatures must be established through simulation of a few days before thermal loads are accumulated. Heavier buildings require more warm-up; the default values are adequate for conventional construction.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*x* $\\ge$ 0",
  default: "7",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**nSubSteps=*int***

Number of subhour steps used per hour in the simulation. 4 is the time-honored value for models using CNE zones. A value of 30 is typically for CSE zone models.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*x* $>$ 0",
  default: "4",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**nSubhrTicks=*int***

  default: "60/nSubSteps",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**tol=*float***

Endtest convergence tolerance for internal iteration in CNE models (no effect for CSE models) Small values for the tolerance cause more accurate simulations but slower performance. The user may wish to use a high number during the initial design process (to quicken the runs) and then lower the tolerance for the final design (for better accuracy). Values other than .001 have not been explored.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*x* $>$ 0",
  default: "0.001",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**humTolF=*float***

Specifies the convergence tolerance for humidity calculations in CNE models (no effect in for CSE models), relative to the tolerance for temperature calculations. A value of .0001 says that a humidity difference of .0001 is about as significant as a temperature difference of one degree. Note that this is multiplied internally by "tol"; to make an overall change in tolerances, change "tol" only.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*x* $\\ge$ 0",
  default: "0.0001",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**ebTolMon=*float***

Monthly energy balance error tolerance for internal consistency checks. Smaller values are used for testing the internal consistency of the simulator; values somewhat larger than the default may be used to avoid error messages when it is desired to continue working despite a moderate degree of internal inconsistency.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*x* $>$ 0",
  default: "0.0001",

  legal_range: "*x* $>$ 0",
  default: "0.0001",

  default: "1.5",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**grndTimeStep=*choice***

Allows the user to choose whether to calculate foundation conduction on hourly or subhourly intervals. Hourly intervals require less overall computation time, but with less accuracy.

  default: "2.64",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**bldgAzm=*float***

Reference compass azimuth (0 = north, 90 = east, etc.). All zone orientations (and therefore surface orientations) are relative to this value, so the entire building can be rotated by changing bldgAzm only. If a value outside the range 0^o^ $\leq$ *x* $<$ 360^o^ is given, it is normalized to that range.

<%= member_table(
  units: "^o^ (degrees)",
  legal_range: "unrestricted",
  default: "0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**elevation=*float***

Elevation of the building site. Used internally for the computation of barometric pressure and air density of the location.

  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**runTitle=*string***

Run title for the simulation. Appears in report footers, export headers, and in the title lines to the INP, LOG, and ERR built-in reports (these appear by default in the primary report file; the ERR report also appears in the error message file, if one is created).

  default: "0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

## TOP Daylight Saving Time Items

Daylight savings starts by default at 2:00 a.m. of the second Sunday in March. Internally, hour 3 (2:00-3:00 a.m.) is skipped and reports for this day show only 23 hours. Daylight savings ends by default at 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday of November; for this day 25 hours are shown on reports. CSE fetches weather data using standard time but uses daylight savings time to calculate variable expressions (and thus all schedules).

**DT=*choice***

Whether Daylight Savings Time is to be used for the current run.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "YES, NO",
  default: "YES",
  required: "No",

  legal_range: "*date*",
  default: "*first Sunday in November*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

## TOP Model Control Items

**ventAvail=*choice***

Indicates availability of outdoor ventilation strategies.  CSE cannot model simultaneously-operating alternative ventilation strategies.  For example, an RSYS central fan integrated (CFI) OAV system is never modeled while whole house fan ventilation is available.  ventAvail controls which ventilation mode, if any, is available for the current hour.  Note that mode availability means that the strategy could operate but may not operate due to other control assumptions.

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => true)
Choice, Ventilation Strategy Available
NONE,          None
WHOLEBUILDING, IZXFER (window and whole-house fan)
RSYSOAV,       RSYS central fan integrated (CFI) outside air ventilation (OAV)
END
%>

As noted, ventAvail is evaluated hourly, permitting flexible control strategy modeling.  The following example specifies that RSYSOAV (CFI) ventilation is available when the seven day moving average temperature is above 68 ^o^F, otherwise whole building ventilation is available between 7 and 11 PM, otherwise no ventilation.

    ventAvail = (@weather.taDbAvg07 > 68)    ? RSYSOAV
              : ($hour >= 19 && $hour <= 23) ? WHOLEBUILDING

PENUMBRA,        Calculate shading using the Penumbra model
NONE,            Disable advanced shading calculations

  default: "CSE",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**ANTolAbs=*float***

AirNet absolute convergence tolerance. Ideally, calculated zone air pressures should be such that the net air flow into each zone is 0 -- that is, there should be a perfect mass balance.  The iterative AirNet solution techniques are deemed converged when netAirMassFlow < max( ANTolAbs, ANTolRel*totAirMassFlow).

<%= member_table(
  units: "lbm/sec",
  legal_range: "*x* $>$ 0",

  default: "0.0001",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

The ASHWAT complex fenestration model used when WINDOW wnModel=ASHWAT yields several heat transfer results that are accurate over local ranges of conditions.  Several values control when these value are recalculated.  If any of the specified values changes more than the associated threshold, a full ASHWAT calculation is triggered.  Otherwise, prior results are used.  ASHWAT calculations are computationally expensive and conditions often change only incrementally between time steps.

**AWTrigT=*float***

ASHWAT temperature change threshold -- full calculation is triggered by a change of either indoor or outdoor environmental (combined air and radiant) temperature that exceeds AWTrigT.

The following values modify weather file data, permitting varying the simulation without making up special weather files. For example, to simulate without the effects of wind, use windF = 0; to halve the effects of diffuse solar radiation, use radDiffF = 0.5. Note that the default values for windSpeedMin and windF result in modification of weather file wind values unless other values are specified.

**grndEmit=*float***

## TOP TDV (Time Dependent Value) Items

CSE supports an optional comma-separated (CSV) text file that provides hourly TDV values for electricity and fuel.  TDV values are read along with the weather file and the values merged with weather data.  Several daily statistics are calculated for use via probes.  The file has no other effect on the simulation.  Only full-year TDV files are supported.

The format of a TDV file is the same as an [IMPORTFILE](#importfile) with the proviso that the 4 line header is not optional and certain header items must have specified values.  In the following table, non-italic items must be provided as shown (with optional quotes).

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => true)

The table below shows probes available for accessing TDV data in expressions.  Except as noted, daily values are updated based on standard time, so they may be inaccurate by small amounts when daylight savings time is in effect.

<%= csv_table(<<END, :row_header => true)
**Probe**,                          **Variability**,      **Description**
@Weather.tdvElec, Hour, current hour electricity TDV
@Weather.tdvFuel, Hour, current hour fuel TDV
@Weather.tdvElecPk, Day, current day peak electricity TDV (includes future hours).  Updated at hour 23 during daylight savings.
@Weather.tdvElecAvg, Day, current day average electricity TDV (includes future hours)
@Weather.tdvElecPvPk, Day,previous day peak electricity TDV
@Weather.tdvElecAvg01, Day,previous day average electricity TDV
@weather.tdvElecHrRank[], Day, hour ranking of TDVElec values.  tdvElecHrRank[ 1] is the hour having the highest TDVElec&comma; tdvElecHrRank[ 2] is the next highest&comma; etc. The hour values are adjusted when dayight savings time is in effect&comma; so they remain consistent with system variable $hour.

**TDVfName=*string***

Note: Backslash (\\) characters in path names must be doubled to work properly (e.g. "\\\\data\\\\mytdv.tdv").  Forward slash (/) may be used in place of backslash without doubling.

  units: "",
  legal_range: "file name, path optional",
  default: "(no TDV file)",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

## TOP Report Data Items

These items are used in page-formatted report output files. See REPORTFILE, Section 5.245.21, and REPORT, Section 5.25.

**repHdrL=*string***

Report left header. Appears at the upper left of each report page unless page formatting (rfPageFmt) is OFF. If combined length of repHdrL and repHdrR is too large for the page width, one or both will be truncated.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**repHdrR=*string***

Report right header. Appears at the upper right of each report page unless page formatting (rfPageFmt) is OFF. If combined length of repHdrL and repHdrR is too large for the page width, one or both will be truncated.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**repLPP=*int***

Total lines per page to be assumed for reports. Number of lines used for text (including headers and footers) is repLPP - repTopM - repBotM.

<%= member_table(
  units: "lines",
  legal_range: "*x* $\\ge$ 50",
  default: "66",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**repTopM=*int***

Number of lines to be skipped at the top of each report page (prior to header).

<%= member_table(
  units: "lines",
  legal_range: "0 $\\geq$ *x* $\\geq$ 12",
  default: "3",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**repBotM=*int***

Number of lines reserved at the bottom of each report page. repBotM determines the position of the footer on the page (blank lines after the footer are not actually written).

<%= member_table(
  units: "lines",
  legal_range: "0 $\\geq$ *x* $\\geq$ 12",
  default: "3",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**repCPL=*int***

Characters per line for report headers and footers, user defined reports, and error messages. CSE writes simple ASCII files and assumes a fixed (not proportional) spaced printer font. Many of the built-in reports now (July 1992) assume a line width of 132 columns.

<%= member_table(
  units: "characters",
  legal_range: "78 $\\leq$ *x* $\\leq$ 132",
  default: "78",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**repTestPfx=*string***

Report test prefix. Appears at beginning of report lines that are expected to differ from prior runs. This is useful for "hiding" lines from text comparison utilities in automated testing schemes. Note: the value specified with command line -x takes precedence over this input.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

## TOP Autosizing

**doAutoSize=*choice***

Controls invocation of autosizing phase prior to simulation.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "YES, NO",
  default: "NO, unless AUTOSIZE commands in input",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**auszTol=*float***

Autosize tolerance.  Sized capacity results are deemed final when successive design day calculations produce results within auszTol of the prior iteration.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: ".005",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**heatDsTDbO=*float***

Heating outdoor dry bulb design temperature used for autosizing heating equipment.

<%= member_table(
  units: "^o^F",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "hourly") %>

**heatDsTWbO=*float***

Heating outdoor Whether bulb design temperature used for autosizing heating equipment.

<%= member_table(
  units: "^o^F",
  legal_range: "*x* $\\ge$ 0",
  default: "derived assuming RH=.7",
  required: "No",
  variability: "hourly") %>

**coolDsDay=*list of up to 12 days***

Specifies cooling design days for autosizing.  Each day will be simulated repeatedly using weather file conditions for that day.

<%= member_table(
  units: "dates",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**coolDsMo=*list of up to 12 months***

Deprecated method for specifying cooling autosizing days.  Design conditions are taken from ET1 weather file header, however, the limited availale ET1 files do not contain design condition information.

<%= member_table(
  units: "months",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "*none*",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**coolDsCond=*descondName***

Cool design condition with 13 different options.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "*name of DESCOND*",
  default: "0.0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>


## TOP Debug Reporting

**verbose=*int***

Controls verbosity of screen remarks. Most possible remarks are generated during autosizing of CNE models. Little or no effect in CSE models. TODO: document options

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "0 - 5",
  default: "1",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

The following dbgPrintMask values provide bitwise control of addition of semi-formated internal results to the run report file. The values and format of debugging reports are modified as required for testing purposes. <!-- TODO: document options -->

**dbgPrintMaskC=*int***

Constant portion of debug reporting control.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "constant") %>

**dbgPrintMask=*int***

Hourly portion of debug reporting control (generally an expression that evaluates to non-0 only on days or hours of interest).

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "hourly") %>

**dbgFlag=*int***

Allows passing an input value to ad-hoc debugging code.  No permanent use; no impact on results.

<%= member_table(
  units: "",
  legal_range: "",
  default: "0",
  required: "No",
  variability: "subhourly") %>
