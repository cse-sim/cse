# AIRHANDLER

AIRHANDLER defines a central air handling system, containing a fan or fans, optional heating and cooling coils, and optional outside air intake and exhaust. AIRHANDLERs are subobjects of TOP, and deliver air to one or more ZONEs through TERMINAL(s). AIRHANDLER objects can be used to model fan ventilation and forced air heating and cooling. Dual duct systems are modeled with two AIRHANDLERs (one for hot air and one for cool air) and two TERMINALs in each zone. Figure 2 shows…. \[need a sentence that explains the figure.\]

![Insert Figure Title](media/image1.png)

AIRHANDLER is designed primarily to model a central system that supplies hot or cold air at a centrally determined temperature (the "Supply Temperature Setpoint") to Variable Air Volume (VAV) terminals in the zones. Some additional variations are also supported:

1.  The AIRHANDLER can model a constant volume, fan-always-on system, where the supply temperature varies to meet the load of a single zone (that is, the thermostat controls the heating and/or cooling coil, but not the fan). This is done by setting the terminal minimum flow, *tuVfMn,* equal to the maximum flow, *tuVfMxH* for heating and/or *tuVfMxC* for cooling, and using a supply temperature control method that adjusts the temperarute to the load (*ahTsSp* = WZ, CZ, or ZN2, described below).

2.  The AIRHANDLER can model constant volume, fan cycling systems where the fan cycles with a single zone thermostat, running at full flow enough of the time to meet the load and shutting completely off the rest of the time, rather than running at variable flow to adjust to the demand from the zones.

    This variation is invoked by specifying *ahFanCycles*= YES (usually with *ahTsSp*=ZN, described below). The user should be aware that this is done by treating fractional flow as equivalent to fractional on-time in most of the program, adjusting for the higher flow and less than 100% duty cycle only in a few parts of the model known to be non-linear, such as computation of cooling coil performance, fan heat, and duct leakage. For example, the outside air inputs, designed for VAV modeling, won't work in the expected manner unless you keep this modeling method in mind.

3.  The AIRHANDLER can supply hot air, cold air, or shut off according to the requirements of a single zone. This variation is invoked by giving *ahTsSp* = ZN or ZN2, both described further below.

## AIRHANDLER Supply Air Temperature Controller

**ahTsSp=*float or choice***

Supply temperature setpoint numeric value OR\* choice of control method (WZ, CZ, RA, ZN, or ZN2):

  ---------- ---------------------------------------
  *float*    A numeric value specifies the supply
             temperature setpoint. An expression can
             be used to make dependent on time,
             weather, etc.

  WZ         Warmest Zone: for cooling, sets the
             supply temperature setpoint each
             sub??hour so that the control zone (see
             *ahWzCzns*) requiring the coolest
             supply temperature can meet its load
             with its VAV damper 90% of the way from
             its minimum opening to its maximum,
             that is, at a flow of: *tuVfMn* +
             .9(*tuVfMxC* - \* tuVfMn\*).

  CZ         Coolest Zone: analogous to WZ, but for
             heating

  RA         Supply temperature setpoint value is
             controlled by return air temperature
             (this cannot be done with a CSE
             expression without lagging a subhour).
             See *ahTsRaMn* and *ahTsRaMx*.

  ZN         Causes air handler to switch between
             heating, OFF, and cooling as required
             by the load of a single zone. When the
             zone thermostat (modeled through the
             *tuTC* and *tuTH* inputs) calls for
             neither heating nor cooling, the air
             handler shuts down, including stopping
             its fan(s). Changes *ahFanCycles*
             default to YES, to simulate a constant
             volume, fan cycling system.

             Supply temperature setpoint value when
             *ahFanCycles* = YES is taken from
             *ahTsMn* for cooling, from *ahTsMx* for
             heating (actual temperatures expected
             to be limited by coil capacity since
             fan is running at full flow). When
             *ahFanCycles* = NO, the setpoint is
             determined to allow meeting the load,
             as for WZ and CZ.

             When the zone is calling for neither
             heat nor cold, the air handler shuts
             down, including stopping its fan(s),
             regardless of the *ahFanCycles* value.

  ZN2        Causes air handler to switch between
             heating, cooling, and FAN ONLY
             operation as required by the load of a
             single zone. To model a constant volume
             system where the fan runs continuously,
             use ZN2 and set the terminal minimum
             flow (*tuVfMn*) equal to the maximum
             (*tuVfMxC* and/or *tuVfMxH*).

             When *ahTsSp* is ZN2, the supply
             temperature setpoint is determined to
             allow meeting the load, as for WZ and
             CZ, described above.
  ---------- ---------------------------------------

Only when *ahTsSp* is ZN or ZN2 does AIRHANDLER switches between heating and cooling supply temperatures according to demand. In other cases, there is but a single setpoint value or control method (RA, CZ, or WZ); if you want the control method or numeric value to change according to time of day or year, outside temperature, etc., your CSE input must contain an appropriate conditional expression for *ahTsSp*.

Unless *ahTsSp* is ZN or ZN2, the AIRHANDLER does not know whether it is heating or cooling, and will use either the heating coil or cooling coil, if available, as necessary, to keep the supply air at the single setpoint temperature. The coil schedule members, described below, allow you to disable present coils when you don't want them to operate, as to prevent cooling supply air that is already warm enough when heating the zones. For example, in an AIRHANDLER with both heating and cooling coils, if you are using a conditional expression based on outdoor temperature to change *ahTsSp* between heating and cooling values, you may use expressions with similar conditions for *ahhcSched* and *ahccSched* to disable the cooling coil when heating and vice versa. (Expressions would also be used in the TERMINALS to activate their heating or cooling setpoints according to the same conditions.)

Giving *ahTsSp* is disallowed for an air handler with no economizer, no heat coil and no cooling coil. Such an AIRHANDLER object is valid as a ventilator; its supply temperature is not controlled. but rather determined by the outside temperature and/or the return air temperature.

CSE delivers flows demanded by terminals until total flow at supply fan reaches sfanVfDs \* sfanVsMxF, then reduces maximum flows to terminals, keeping them in proportion to terminal design flows, to keep total flow at that value.

Design or rated pressure. The work done by the fan is computed as the product of this pressure and the current flow, except that the flow is limited to sfanVfDs. That is, in overrun (see *sfanVfMxF*) it is assumed that large VAV terminal damper openings allow the pressure to drop in proportion to the flow over rated. This work is added to the air as heat at the fan, and is termed "fan heat". Setting sfanPress to zero will eliminate simulated fan heat for theoretical simulation of a coil only.

Prior text: At most, one of the next two items may be given: in combination with sfanVfDs and sfanPress, either is sufficient to compute the other. SfanCurvePy is then used to compute the mechanical power at the fan shaft at partial loads; sfanMotEff allows determining the electrical input from the shaft power.

New possible text (after addition of sfanElecPwr): Only one of sfanElecPwr, sfanEff, and sfanShaftBhp may be given: together with sfanVfDs and xfanPress, any one is sufficient for CSE to detemine the others and to compute the fan heat contribution to the air stream. <!-- TODO: fix! 7-29-2011 -->

## AIRHANDLER Heating coil/Modeling Furnaces

Heating coils are optional devices that warm the air flowing through the AIRHANDLER, including electric resistance heaters, hot water coils supplied by a HEATPLANT, the heating function of an air source heat pump, and furnaces.

Furnaces are modeled as AIRHANDLERs with heat "coils" that model the heating portion of a gas or oil forced hot air furnace. Notes on modeling a furnace with a CSE AIRHANDLER:

-   Give *ahhcType* = GAS or OIL.
-   Give *ahhcAux's* to model the power consumption of pilot, draft fan, etc.
-   Use *ahTsSp* = ZN, which implies *ahFanCyles* = YES, to model constant volume, fan cycling (as opposed to VAV) operation.
-   Use *ahTsMx* = an appropriate value around 140 or 180 to limit the supply temperature, simulating the furnace's high temperature cutout (the default *ahTsMx*of 999 is too high!).
-   Use a single TERMINAL on the AIRHANDLER.
-   To eliminate confusion about the fan cfm (which, precisely, under *ahFanCyles* = YES, is the smaller of the terminal maximum or the supply fan maximum including overrun), give the same value for TERMINAL *tuVfMxH* and AIRHANDLER *sfanVfDs*, and give *sfanVfMxF* = 1.0 to eliminate overrun.
-   You will usually want to use *oaVfDsMn* = 0 (no outside air), and no economizer.

The heating function of an air source heat pump is modeled with an AIRHANDLER with heat coil type AHP. There are several additional heat coil input variables (names beginning with *ahp-*) described later in the heat coil section. Also, a heat pump generally has a crankcase heater, which is specified with the crankcase heater inputs (*cch-*), described later in the AIRHANDLER Section 0. If the heat pump also performs cooling, its cooling function is modeled by specifying a suitable cooling coil in the same AIRHANDLER. Use *ahccType* = DX until a special cooling coil type for heat pumps is implemented. It is the user's responsibility to specify consistent heating and cooling coil inputs when the intent is to model a heat pump that both heats and cools, as CSE treats the heat coil and the cool coil as separate devices.

The next four members apply to all heat coil types, except as noted.

To specify that an AIRHANDLER has a heating coil and thus heating capability, give an *ahhcType* other than NONE.

**ahhcType=*choice***

Coil type choice:

  ------------- ---------------------------------------
  ELECTRIC      electric resistance heat: 100%
                efficient, can deliver its full rated
                capacity at any temperature and flow.

  HW            hot water coil, supplied by a HEATPLANT
                object.

  GAS or OIL    "coil" type that models heating portion
                of a forced hot air furnace. Furnace
                "coil" model uses inputs for full-load
                efficiency and part-load power input;
                model must be completed with
                appropriate auxiliaries, *ahTsSp,* etc.
                See notes above.

                GAS and OIL are the same here -- the
                differences between gas- and oil-fired
                furnaces is in the auxiliaries (pilot
                vs. draft fan, etc.), which you specify
                separately.

  AHP           heating function of an air source heat
                pump.

  NONE          AIRHANDLER has no heat coil, thus no
                heating capability.

**ahhcSched=*choice***

Heat coil schedule; choice of AVAIL or OFF, hourly variable. Use an appropriate ahhcSched expression if heat coil is to operate only at certain times of the day or year or only under certain weather conditions, etc.

  -------- ---------------------------------------
  AVAIL    heat coil available: will operate as
           necessary to heat supply air to supply
           temperature setpoint, up to the coil's
           capacity.

  OFF      coil will not operate, no matter how
           cold supply air is. A HW coil should be
           scheduled off whenever its HEATPLANT is
           scheduled off (*hpSched*) to insure
           against error messages.

**ahhcCapTRat=*float***

Total heating (output) capacity. For an ELECTRIC, GAS, or OIL coil, this capacity is always available. For an HW heating coil, when the total heat being requested from the coil's HEATPLANT would overload the HEATPLANT, the capacity of all HW coils connected to the plant (in TERMINALs as well as AIRHANDLERs) is reduced proportionately until the requested total heat is within the HEATPLANT's capacity. Not used if *ahhcType* = AHP (see *ahpCap17* and *ahpCap47*).

**ahhcMtr=*mtrName***

Name of meter to accumulate energy use by this heat coil. The input energy used by the coil is accumulated in the end use category "Htg"; for a heat pump, the en*ergy used by the supplemental resistance heaters (regular and defrost) is accumulated under the category "hp". Not allowed when*ahhcType\* is HW, as an HW coil's energy comes from its HEATPLANT, and the HEATPLANT's BOILERs accumulate input energy to meters.

One of the next two items, but not both, **must** be given for furnaces:

**ahhcPyEi=$k_0$, $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$**

Coefficients of cubic polynomial function of (subhour average) part-load-ratio (plrAv) to adjust the full-load furnace energy input for part load operation. Enter, separated by commas, in order, the constant part, the coefficient of plrAv, the coefficient of plrAv squared, and the coefficient of plrAv cubed. CSE will normalize the coefficients if necessary to make the polynomial value be 1.0 when the part load ratio is 1.0.

The default, from DOE2, is equivalent to:

        ahhcPyEi = .01861, 1.094209, -.112819, 0.;

which corresponds to the quadratic polynomial:

$$\text{pyEi}(\text{plrAv}) = 0.01861 + 1.094209 \cdot \textbf{plrAv} - 0.112819 \cdot \textbf{plrAv}^2$$

Note that the value of this polynomial adjusts the energy input, not the energy input ratio, for part load operation.

**ahhcStackEffect=*float***

Fraction of unused furnace capacity that must be used to make up for additional infiltration caused by stack effect of a hot flue when the (indoor) furnace is NOT running, only in subhours when furnace runs PART of the subhour, per DOE2 model.

This is an obscure feature that will probably never be used, included only due to indecisiveness on the part of most members of the committee designing this program. The first time reader should skip this section, or read it only as an example of deriving an expression to implement a desired relationship.

The stack effect is typically a function of the square root of the difference between the outdoor temperature and the assumed stack temperature.

For example, the following is a typical example for furnace stack effect:

        ahhcStackEffect =  @Top.tDbO >= 68.  ?  0.
                            :  (68. - @Top.tDbO)
                               * sqrt(200.-@Top.tDbO)
                               / (10*68*sqrt(200));

The code "`@Top.tDbO >= 68 ? 0. : ...`" insures that the value will be 0, not negative, when it is warmer than 68 out (if the furnace were to run when the value was negative, a run-time error would terminate the run).

The factor "`(68. - @Top.tDbO)`" reflects the fact that the energy requirement to heat the infiltrating air is proportional to how much colder it is than the indoor temperature. Note that its permitted to use a constant for the indoor temperature because if it is below setpoint, the furnace will be running all the time, and there will be no unused capacity and the value of ahhcStackEffect will be moot.

The factor "`sqrt(200.-@Top.tDbO)`" represents the volume of infiltrated air that is typically proportional to the square root of the driving temperature difference, where 200 is used for the estimated effective flue temperature.

The divisor "`/ (10*68*sqrt(200))`" is to make the value 0.1 when tDbO is 0, that is, to make the stack effect loss use 10% of unused load when it is 0 degrees out. The actual modeling engineer must know enough about his building to be able to estimate the additional infiltration load at some temperature.

The following heat coil input members, beginning with *ahp-*, are used when modeling the heating function of an air source heat pump with the air handler heat coil, that is, when *ahhcType*= AHP is given. Also, see the "AIRHANDLER Crankcase Heater" section with regard to specifying the heat pump's crankcase heater.

The next six inputs give the heat pump's steady state heating output capacity.

**ahpCap17=*float***

**ahpCap47=*float***

ARI steady state (continuous operation) rated capacities at 70 degrees F indoor (return) air temp, and 17 and 47 degrees F outdoor temp, respectively. These values reflect no cycling, frost, or defrost degradation. To help you find input errors, the program issues an error message if ahpCap17 &gt;= ahpCap47.

The next seven inputs specify frost buildup and defrosting and their effect on capacity.

**ahpTFrMn=*float***

**ahpTFrMx=*float***

**ahpTFrPk=*float***

Lowest, highest, and peak temperatures for frost buildup and defrost effects. Capacity reduction due to frost and defrosting consists of a component due to frost buildup on the outdoor coil, plus a component due to lost heating during the time the heat pump is doing reverse cycle defrosting (heating the outdoor coil to melt off the frost, which cools the indoor coil). The effects of Frost Buildup and of time spent defrosting are computed for different temperature ranges as follows:

-   Above *ahpTFrMx*: no frost buildup, no defrosting.

-   At *ahpTFrMx* OR *ahpTFrMn*: defrosting time per *ahpDfrFMn* (next description); no frost buildup effect.

-   At *ahpTFrPk*: defrosting time per *ahpDfrFMx*, plus additional output reduction due to effect of frost buildup, computed by linear extrapolation from *ahpCap35* or its default.

-   Between *ahpTFrPk* and *ahpTFrMn* or *ahpTFrMx*: defrost time and defrost buildup degradation linearly interpolated between values at *ahpTFrPk* and values at *ahpTFrMn* or *ahpTFrMx*.

-   Below *ahpTFrMn*: no frost buildup effect; time defrosting remains at *ahpDfrFMn*.

In other words, the curve of capacity loss due to frost buildup follows straight lines from its high point at *ahpTFrPk* to zero at *ahpTFrMn* and *ahpTFrMx*, and remains zero outside the range *ahpTFrMn* to *ahpTFrMx*. The height of the high point is determined to match the *ahpCap35* input value or its default. The curve of time spent defrosting is described in other words in the description of *ahpDfrFMn* and *ahpDfrFMx*, next.

An error will occur unless *ahpTFrMn* &lt; *ahpTFrPk* &lt; *ahpTFrMx* and *ahpTFrMn* &lt; 35 &lt; *ahpTFrMx*.

**ahpDfrFMn=*float***

**ahpDfrFMx=*float***

Minimum and maximum fraction of time spent in reverse cycle defrost cooling.

The fraction of the time spent defrosting depends on the outdoor temperature, as follows: at or below *ahpTFrMn*, and at (but not above) *ahpTFrMx*, *ahpDfrFMn* is used. *ahpDfrFMx* is used at *ahpTFrMx*. Linear interpolation is used between *ahpTFrMn* or *ahpTFrMx* and *ahpTFrMx*. No time is spent defrosting above *ahpTFrMx*.

In other words, the curve of time spent defrosting versus outdoor temperature has the value *ahpDfrFMn* up to *ahpTFrMn*, then rises in a straight line to *ahpDfrFMx* at *ahpTFrMx*, then falls in a straight line back to *ahpDfrFMn* at *ahpTFrMx*, then drops directly to zero for all higher temperatures.

During the fraction of the time spent defrosting, the heat pump's input remains constant and the output is changed as follows:

-   Usual heat output is not delivered to load.

-   Cold output due to reverse cycle operation is delivered to load. See *ahpDfrCap*.

-   An additional resistance heater is operated; and its heat output is delivered to load. See *ahpDfrRh*.

The program will issue an error message if *ahpDfrFMx* $\le$ *ahpDfrFMn*.

## AIRHANDLER Cooling coil

A cooling coil is an optional device that remove heat and humidity from the air passing through the AIRHANDLER. Available cooling coil types include chilled water (CHW), supported by a COOLPLANT that supplies cold water, and Direct Expansion (DX), supported by a dedicated compressor and condenser that are modeled integrally with the DX coil. No plant is used with DX coils.

The following five members are used for all cool coil types except as noted. Presence of a cool coil in the AIRHANDLER is indicated by giving an *ahccType value* other than NONE.

**ahccType*=choice***

Cool coil type choice:

  ----------- ---------------------------------------
  ELECTRIC    Testing artifice: removes heat at 100%
              efficiency up to rated capacity at any
              flow and temperature; removes no
              humidity. Use in research runs to
              isolate effects of coil models from
              other parts of the CSE program.

  CHW         CHilled Water coil, using a cold water
              from a COOLPLANT.

  DX          Direct Expansion coil, with dedicated
              compressor and condenser modeled
              integrally.

  NONE        AIRHANDLER has no cooling coil and no
              cooling capability.

**ahccSched*=choice***

Cooling coil schedule choice, hourly variable. Use a suitable CSE expression for ahccSched if cooling coil is to operate only at certain times, only in hot weather, etc.

  -------- ---------------------------------------
  AVAIL    Cooling coil will operate as necessary
           (within its capacity) to cool the
           supply air to the supply temperature
           setpoint.

  OFF      Cooling coil will not operate no matter
           how hot the supply air is. To avoid
           error messages, a CHW coil should be
           scheduled OFF whenever its COOLPLANT is
           scheduled OFF.
  -------- ---------------------------------------

**ahccCapTRat=*float***

Total rated capacity of coil: sum of its "sensible" (heat-removing) and "latent" (moisture removing) capacities. Not used with CHW coils, for which capacity is implicitly specified by water flow (ahccGpmDs*) and transfer unit (*ahccNtuoDs\* and *ahccNtuiDs*) inputs, described below.

**ahccMinTEvap=*float***

Used as K1 in the relationship ntu = ntuR \* relCfmk1, which says that the "number of transfer units" (on the coil outside or air side) varies with the relative air flow raised to the K1 power. Used with CHW as well as DX coils; for a CHW coil, ntuR in the formula is *ahccNtuoDs*.

The next three members are used in determining the energy input to a DX coil under various load conditions. The input is derived from the full load energy input ratio for four segments of the part load curve. <!-- Reproduce Nile's pretty curve here?? --> In the following the part load ratio (plr) is the ratio of the actual sensible + latent load on the coil to the coil's capacity. The coil's capacity is ahccCaptRat, adjusted by the coil model for differences between entering air temperature, humidity, and flow rate and the coil rating conditions. The coil may run at less than capacity even at full fan flow, depending on the air temperature change needed, the moisture content of the entering air, and the relative values of between *sfanVfDs* and *ahccVfR*.

                                 for the necessary fraction of the time,
                                 and the power input is the false

The following four inputs specify polynomials to approximate functions giving DX coil capacity and power (energy) input as functions of entering temperatures, relative (to ahccVfR) flow, and relative load (plr). In each case several *float* values may be given, for use as coefficients of the polynomial. The values are ordered from constant to coefficient of highest power. If fewer than the maximum number of values are given, zeroes are used for the trailing (high order) coefficients.

Examples:

        pydxCaptT = 2.686, -0.01667, 0, 0.006, 0, 0;

        pydxCaptT = 2.686, -0.01667, 0, 0.006; // same

        pydxEirUl = .9, 1.11, .023, -.00345;

If the polynomial does not evaluate to 1.0 when its inputs are equal to the rating conditions (1.0 for relative flows and plr), CSE will normalize your coefficients by dividing them by the non-1.0 value.

Some of the polynomials are biquadratic polynomials whose variables are the entering air wetbulb and drybulb temperatures. These are of the form

$$z = a + bx + cx^2 + dy + ey^2 + fxy$$

where a through f are user-inputtable coefficients, x is the entering wetbulb temperature, y is the entering drybulb temperature, and the polynomial value, z, is a factor by which the coil's capacity, power input, etc. at rated conditions is multiplied to adjust it for the actual entering air temperatures.

Other polynomials are cubic polynomials whose variable is the air flow or load as a fraction of full flow or load.. These are of the form

$$z = a + bx + cx^2+ dx^3$$

where a, b, c, and d are user-inputtable coefficients, $x$ is the variable, and the value $z$ is a factor by which the coil's capacity, power input, etc. at rated conditions is multiplied to adjust it for the actual flow or load.

The default values for the polynomial coefficients are the DOE2 PTAC values.

**pydxCaptT=a, b, c, d, e, f**

Coefficients of biquadratic polynomial function of entering air wetbulb and condenser temperatures whose value is used to adjust *ahccCaptRat* for the actual entering air temperatures. The condenser temperature is the outdoor drybulb, but not less than 70. See discussion in preceding paragraphs.

## AIRHANDLER Outside Air

Outside air introduced into the air hander supply air can be controlled on two levels. First, a *minimum*fraction or volume of outside air may be specified. By default, a minimum volume of .15 cfm per square foot of zone area is used. Second, an *economizer* may be specified. The simulated economizer increases the outside air above the minimum when the outside air is cooler or has lower enthalpy than the return air, in order to reduce cooling coil energy usage. By default, there is no economizer.

**oaMnCtrl=*choice***

Minimum outside air flow control method choice, VOLUME or FRACTION. Both computations are based on the minimum outside air flow, *oaVfDsMn*; if the control method is FRACTION, the outside air flow is pro-rated when the air handler is supplying less than its design cfm. In both cases the computed minimum cfm is multiplied by a schedulable fraction, *oaMnFrac*, to let you vary the outside air or turn in off when none is desired.

  ----------- ---------------------------------------
  VOLUME      Volume (cfm) of outside air is
              regulated:

              min\_oa\_flow = oaMnFrac \* oaVfDsMn

  FRACTION    Fraction of outside air in supply air
              is regulated. The fraction is oaVfDsMn
              divided by sfanVfDs, the air handler
              supply fan design flow. The minimum cfm
              of outside air is thus computed as

              min\_oa\_flow = oaMnFrac \* curr\_flow
              \* oaVfDsMn / sfanVfDs

              where curr\_flow is the current air
              handler cfm.
  ----------- ---------------------------------------

If the minimum outside air flow is greater than the total requested by the terminals served by the air handler, then 100% outside air at the latter flow is used. To insure minimum outside air cfm to the zones, use suitable terminal minimum flows (*tuVfMn*) as well as air handler minimum outside air specifications.

**oaMnFrac=*float***

Fraction of minimum outside air to use this hour, normally 1.0. Use a CSE expression that evaluates to 0 for hours you wish to disable the minimum outside air flow, for example to suppress ventilation during the night or during warm-up hours. Intermediate values may be used for intermediate outside air minima. See formulas in *oaMnCtrl* description, above.

              0 $\le$ *x* $\le$ 1   1.0           No             hourly

CAUTION: the minimum outside air flow only applies when the supply fan is running; it won't assure meeting minimum ventilation requirements when used with ahFanCycles = YES (constant volume, fan cycling).

If an *oaEcoType* choice other than NONE is given, an economizer will be simulated. The economizer will be enabled when the outside temperature is below oaLimT *AND* the outside air enthalpy is below oaLimE. When enabled, the economizer adjusts the economizer dampers to increase the outside air mixed with the return air until the mixture is cooler than the air handler supply temperature setpoint, if possible, or to maximum outside air if the outside air is not cool enough.

CAUTIONS: the simulated economizer is just as dumb as the hardware being simulated. Two considerations particularly require attention. First, if enabled when the outside air is warmer than the return air, it will do the worst possible thing: use 100% outside air. Prevent this by being sure your oaLimT or oaLimE input disables the economizer when the outside air is too warm -- or leave the oaLimT = RA default in effect.

Second, the economizer will operate even if the air handler is heating, resulting in use of more than minimum outside air should the return air get above the supply temperature setpoint. Economizers are intended for cooling air handlers; if you heat and cool with the same air handler, consider disabling the economizer when heating by scheduling a very low *oaLimT* or *oaLimE*.

**oaEcoType=*choice***

  NONE             No economizer; outside air flow is the
                   minimum.

  INTEGRATED       Coil and economizer operate
                   independently.

  NONINTEGRATED    Coil does not run when economizer is
                   using all outside air: simulates
                   interlock in some equipment designed to
                   prevent coil icing due to insufficient
                   load, right?

*oaOaLeak* and *oaRaLeak* specify leakages in the economizer dampers, when present. The leaks are constant-cfm flows, expressed as fractions of the maximum possible flow. Thus, when the current flow is less than the maximum possible, the range of operation of the economizer is reduced. When the two damper leakages add up to more than the current air handler flow, outside and return air are used in the ratio of the two leakages and the economizer, if enabled, is ineffective.

**oaOaLeak=*float***

Outside air damper leakage to mixed air. Puts a minimum on return air flow and thus a maximum on outside air flow, to mixed air. If an economizer is present, *oaOaLeak* is a fraction of the supply fan design cfm, *sfanVfDs*. Otherwise, *oaOaLeak* is a fraction of the design minimum outside air flow *oaVfDsMn*.

## AIRHANDLER Leaks and Losses

*AhSOLeak* and *ahRoLeak* express air leaks in the common supply and return ducts, if any, that connect the air handler to the conditioned space. For leakage after the point where a duct branches off to an individual zone, see TERMINAL member *tuSRLeak*. These inputs model leaks in constant pressure (or vacuum) areas nearer the supply fan than the terminal VAV dampers; thus, they are constant volume regardless of flow to the zones. Hence, unless 0 leakage flows are specified, the air handler cfm is greater than the sum of the terminal cfm's, and the air handler cfm is non-0 even when all terminal flows are 0. Any heating or cooling energy applied to the excess cfm is lost to the outdoors.

If unequal leaks are specified, at present (July 1992) CSE will use the average of the two specifications for both leaks, as the modeled supply and return flows must be equal. A future version may allow unequal flows, making up the difference in exfiltration or infiltration to the zones.

**ahSOLeak=*float***

Supply duct leakage to outdoors, expressed as a fraction of supply fan design flow (*sfanVfDs*). Use 0 if the duct is indoors. A constant-cfm leak is modeled, as the pressure is constant when the fan is on.

*AhSOLoss* and *ahROLoss* represent conductive losses from the common supply and return ducts to the outdoors. For an individual zone's conductive duct loss, see TERMINAL member *tuSRLoss*. Losses here are expressed as a fraction of the temperature difference which is lost. For example, if the supply air temperature is 120, the outdoor temperature is 60, and the pertinent loss is .1, the effect of the loss as modeled will be to reduce the supply air temperature by 6 degrees ( .1 \* (120 - 60) ) to 114 degrees. CSE currently models these losses a constant *TEMPERATURE LOSSes* regardless of cfm.

## AIRHANDLER Crankcase Heater

A "crankcase heater" is an electric resistance heater in the crankcase of the compressor of heat pumps and dx cooling coils. The function of the crankcase heater is to keep the compressor's oil warmer than the refrigerant when the compressor is not operating, in order to prevent refrigerant from condensing into and remaining in the oil, which impairs its lubricating properties and shortens the life of the compressor. Manufacturers have come up with a number of different methods for controlling the crankcase heater. The crankcase heater can consume a significant part of the heat pump's energy input; thus, it is important to model it.

In CSE a heat pump is modeled as though it were separate heating and cooling coils. However, the crankcase heater may operate (or not, according to its control method) whether the heat pump is heating, or cooling, or, in particular, doing neither, so it is modeled as a separate part of the air handler, not associated particularly with heating or cooling.

When modeling an air source heat pump (ahhcType = AHP), these variables should be used to specify the crankcase heater, insofar as non-default inputs are desired.

Appropriateness of use of these inputs when specifying a DX system without associated heat pump heating is not clear to me (Rob) as of 10-23-92; on the one hand, the DX compressor probably has a crankcase heater; on the other hand, the rest of the DX model is supposed to be complete in itself, and adding a crankcase heater here might produce excessive energy input; on the third hand, the DX model does not include any energy input when the compressor is idle; ... .

                does not run in subhour (see *cchTMx*, *cchMn*, and
                *cchDT*). If compressor runs at all in subhour, the oil
                is assumed to be hotter than *cchTMn* and crankcase
                heater input is *cchPMn*. (PTC stands for "Positive
                Temperature Coefficient" or "Proportional Temperature
                Control".)

  TSTAT         Control based on outdoor temperature, with optional
                differential, during subhours when compressor is off;
                crankcase heater does not operate if compressor runs at
                all in subhour. See *cchTOn*, *cchTOff*.

See *cchDT* (next).

(Note that actual thermostat setpoints probably cannot be used for *cchTMx* and *cchTMn* inputs, because the model assumes the difference between the oil temperature and the outdoor temperature is constant (*cchDT*) regardless of the heater power. <!-- Presumably the data the user will have will be the actual setpoints, and a formula should be established telling the user how to adjust his data for these inputs. Or, better, the program could make the adjustment.
