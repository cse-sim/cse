# This flag determines whether the "table pre-processing language" is made
# active during ERB preprocessing or not. If this is set to "true", then
# the directives available in lib/table.rb in the class Main are available

# if true, the build directory will be automatically deleted after output
# is created. Defaults to false as the system only rebuilds what is needed
# so it is more efficient to keep the build directory around. Note: this
# is the same as calling "rake clean" after building and will only be
# invoked on the default "rake" or "rake build" tasks. Also, NOTE that
# if your output directory is inside of the build directory, it will
# be deleted, too!
delete-build-dir?: false
# this variable holds various "flags" to pass into the ERB preprocessor
# NOTE: Only define variable keys that could be standard Ruby variables!
#       For example, "some-variable: 10" would not work since "some-variable"
#       is not a valid Ruby variable name. On a related note, all variables must
#       be lower case due to a restriction of how we pass these variables into
#       the ERB preprocessor and due to Ruby associating a semantics with upper
#       case names.
