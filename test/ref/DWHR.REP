        // Occupancy levels are 1-6, representing the number of people residing in the
        //  house that the draw comes from (6 = 6 or more people).
        //
        // Day type is one of:
        //  - D (Weekday)
        //  - E (Weekend)
        //  - H (Holiday)
        //
        // Profile number: For each combination of occupancy level and day type, there
        //  are several representative day profiles selected (see Kruis report for
        //  methodology). The profiles are selected from equal spaced bins of all
        //  days in the measurement data set based on daily total water use. There are
        //  10 bins for weekdays and weekends, and 4 bins for holidays (due to sample
        //  size limitations).
        //
        //  For example, weekdays have profile numbers 0-9. 0 being the day selected
        //  from the bin with the lowest daily totals, and 9 being the day selected from
        //  the bin with the highest daily totals.
        //
        // e.g., "4D8" is the ninth (hence 8 with index zero) weekday profile from a
        //  four person home
