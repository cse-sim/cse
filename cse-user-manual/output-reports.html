<h1 id="output-reports">5 Output Reports</h1><p>CSE report data is accumulated during simulation and written to the report file at the end of the run. Some reports are generated by default and cannot be turned off. There are a set of predefined reports which may be requested in the input. The user may also define custom reports which include many CSE internal variables. Reports may accumulate data on an a variety of frequencies including subhourly, hourly, daily, monthly, and annual (run) intervals.</p><h2 id="units">5.1 Units</h2><p>The default units for CSE reports are:</p><table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Energy</td><td style="text-align:left">mBtu, millions of Btu (to convert to kWh divide by 292)</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">Temperature</td><td style="text-align:left">degrees Farenheit</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Air Flow</td><td style="text-align:left">cfm (cubic feet per minute)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="time">5.2 Time</h2><p>Hourly reports show hour 1 through 24 where hour 1 includes the time period from midnight to 1 AM. By default, CSE specifies that January first is a Thursday and the simulation occurs on a non-leap year. Daylight savings is in effect from the second Sunday of March on which CSE skips hour 3 until the first Sunday of November when CSE simulates 25 hours. These calendar defaults can be modified as required.</p><h2 id="meter-reports">5.3 METER Reports</h2><p>A Meter Report displays the energy use of a <a href="meter.html#meter">METER</a> object, a user-defined “device” that records energy consumption of equipment as simulated by CSE. CSE allows the user to define as many meters as desired and to assign any energy using device to any meter.</p><p>Meters account for energy use in pre-defined categories, called <em>end uses, that are documented with <a href="meter.html#meter">METER.</a></em></p><h2 id="energy-balance-report">5.4 Energy Balance Report</h2><p>The Energy Balance Report displays the temperature and sensible and latent heat flows into and out of the air of a single zone. Sign conventions assume that a positive flow increases the air temperature. Heat flow from a warm mass element such as a concrete wall into the zone air is defined as a positive flow, heat flow from air into mass is negative. Solar gain into the zone is defined as a positive heat flow. Solar gain that is incident on and absorbed directly into a mass element is shown as both a positve in the SOLAR column (gain to the zone) and a negative in the MASS column (lost from the zone to the mass).</p><p>In a real building zone energy and moisture flows must balance due to the laws of physics. CSE uses approximate solutions for the energy and moisture balances and displays the net balance which is a measure of internal calculation error.</p><p>The following items are displayed (using the abbreviations shown in the report headings):</p><table style="width:97%"><colgroup><col style="width:16%"><col style="width:80%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Tair</td><td>Air temperature in the zone (since CSE uses combined films this is technically the effective temperature and includes radiant effects).</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">WBair</td><td>Wet Bulb temperature in the zone.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Cond</td><td>Heat flow through light weight surfaces from or to the outdoors.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">InfS</td><td>Sensible infiltration heat flow from outdoors.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Slr</td><td>Solar gain through glazing (net) and solar gains absorbed by light surfaces and transmitted into the zone air.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">IgnS</td><td>Sensible internal gains from lights, equipment, people, etc.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Mass</td><td>Net heat flow to (negative) and from (positive) the mass elements of the zone.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">Izone</td><td>Net heat flows to other zones in the building.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">MechS</td><td>Net heat flows from heating, cooling and ventilation.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">BALS</td><td>The balance (error) calculated by summing the sensible gains and losses.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">InfL</td><td>Latent infiltration heat flow.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">IgnL</td><td>Latent internal gains.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">AirL</td><td>Latent heat absorbed (negative) or released (positive) by changes in the room air moisture content.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">MechL</td><td>Latent heat added or removed by cooling or ventilation.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">BalL</td><td>The balance (error) calculated by summing the sensible gains and losses.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="air-handler-load-report">5.5 Air Handler Load Report</h2><p>The Air Handler Load Report displays conditions and loads at the peak load hours for the air handler for a single zone.

Most of the columns are values at the time of peak part load ratio (plr). Note that, for example, the peak sensible load is the sensible load at the time of peak part load ratio, even if there was a higher sensible load at another time when the part load ratio was smaller.</p><table style="width:97%"><colgroup><col style="width:10%"><col style="width:86%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">PkMo</td><td style="text-align:left">Month of cooling coil peak plr, 1-12</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">Dy</td><td style="text-align:left">Day of month 1-31 of peak</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Hr</td><td style="text-align:left">Hour of day 1-24 of cooling coil peak plr.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">Tout</td><td style="text-align:left">Outdoor drybulb temperature at time of cooling coil peak plr.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Wbou</td><td style="text-align:left">Outdoor wetbulb similarly</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">Ten</td><td style="text-align:left">Cooling coil entering air temperature at time of peak plr.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">Wben</td><td style="text-align:left">Entering wetbulb similarly</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">Tex</td><td style="text-align:left">Exiting air temperature at plr peak</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left"></td><td style="text-align:left">WbexExiting air wetbulb similarly</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">-PkQs</td><td style="text-align:left">Sensible load at time of peak plr, shown positive.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">-PkQl</td><td style="text-align:left">Latent load likewise</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align:left">-PkQC</td><td style="text-align:left">Total load – sum of PkQs and PkQl</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align:left">CPlr</td><td style="text-align:left">Peak part load ratio: highest fraction of coil’s capacity used, reflecting both fraction of maximum output under current conditions used when on and fraction of the time the fan is on.

The fraction of maximum output used can only be 1.0 if the sensible and total loads happen to occur in the same ratio as the sensible and total capacities. The time the fan is on can be less than 1.0 for residential systems in which the fan cycles on with the compressor. For example, if at the cooling peak the coil ran at .8 power with the fan on .9 of the time, a CPlr of .72 would be reported.

It is important to note that the air handler report only accumulates data if the air handler is on during an hour. The daily and monthly values are averages of the hours the air handler was on and DO NOT INCLUDE OFF HOUR VALUES.
